# SmoothWeb
We want a website that is fullfilling all the requirements by the SEs and we want to share and discuss it you all.
We are looking for some innovative CMS to use for our SEO projects.
Currently we are using Wordpress.
Wordpress is good but if you think of proper SEO it's not that level you have to install or use too many plugins that make it bit chunky.
So we are looking for an option that really can help build a great website onpage.
